The program in the file "Multiple_regression.py" executes multiple linear regression without the use of "OneHotEncoder" which is used while
analysing the categorical data (Eg : Here, Company and Car names is categorical data).

The program takes the input of the company and the car name and at a particular volume (also an input), it predicts the "CO2" emission of the vehicle.

We read the csv file, "data.csv" using pandas library and perform linear regression by importing linear_model from sklearn library.
Therefore, before proceeding install pandas and sklearn.

Save the files "Multiple_regression.py" and "data.csv" in a folder and execute it.(You can execute it in command prompt).
